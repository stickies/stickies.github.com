* describe previous post and some previous solutions
In a [previous post](/2013/1/12/autocompletion-in-vim.html) I went through some of the built in autocompletion functionality in Vim. But there are so many more solutions that I didn't touch on/know about. Here are a few:

  * [neocomplcache](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache.vim)
  * [autocomplpop](https://bitbucket.org/ns9tks/vim-autocomplpop/)
  * [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
  * [clang_complete](https://github.com/Rip-Rip/clang_complete)
  * [Supertab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab)
  And finally, my new favorite for 2014 ...
  * [neocomplete]()

### Vim 7.4 release and lua
At the end of 2013 Vim 7.4 was released. This version includes support for the lua language.
> *Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.* - __[www.lua.org](www.lua.org)__

You can find out more about the lua vim integration [here](http://ujihisa.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/iflua-accelerates-vim-scripts.html).and [here](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/if_lua.html).
