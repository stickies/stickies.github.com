As a programmer it is important to try and maximise your productivity, I find that the less I depend on the mouse, the better my productivity. There are of course many tools out there which can help your fingers to never leave the keyboard, and I'd like to delve into few set ups to compare them.

I've been a user of macvim, terminal, and the macosx navigation system for a few years now. Over time I've built up a workflow that involves many different tools, a shrinking dependency on the mouse and a plethora of shortcut combo's that I find have helped imrove my workflow over time.

I use iterm2 for a terminal ( only recently switched from mac terminal for my sins ) which is such an awesome tool, macvim as text editor and I use SizeUp to manage my windowing between applications such as chrome, vim and the terminal, combined with the tabbing systems of each app respectively and layering windows of each with my favorite key combo:
  ⌘ \`

However there is just something about using tmux sessions with vim that just *feels* faster which I just can't put my finger on, for some reason it just feels nicer, even though, to be honest, alot of the navigation combos can conflict with vi and are quite awkwark in comparison to the SizeUp ⌘ \` combo. Plus if you're using tmu and you need to scroll the output, have fun, it's quite painful in my opinion. Despite this though, it's still great for some reason.
